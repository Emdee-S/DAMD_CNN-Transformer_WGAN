The breast ultrasound images from 256 patients were collected at medical centers in Poland in 2019â€“2022. 
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Bioethics Committee at the Lower Silesian Chamber of Medicine no. 2/BNR/2022. 
The requirement of obtaining written informed consent from patients was forgone because retrospective data collection has 
not impacted the standard diagnostic procedures and all data has been anonymized before being entered into the database
